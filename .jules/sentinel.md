## 2026-05-28 - [Sentinel Fixes: Temp Files & Injection]
**Vulnerability:** Predictable Temp Files (CWE-377) and Insecure Default Permissions (CWE-276), plus Command Injection via FFmpeg Filtergraph (CWE-20).
**Learning:** Python's `Path.with_name` plus a suffix string to make a temp file opens a race condition because it's predictable and the permissions default to system `umask` which might expose secret `0600` data. Additionally, interpolating variables directly into FFmpeg filtergraph strings allows arbitrary filter injection.
**Prevention:** Use `tempfile.mkstemp` which generates unguessable names and creates the file with secure `0600` permissions automatically. Use strict regex allow-lists for string parameters passed into complex shell-like arguments such as FFmpeg's `-af`.
