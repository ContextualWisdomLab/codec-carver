## 2024-05-29 - Unsafe Metadata Copying
**Vulnerability:** Use of `shutil.copymode(source, dest)` preserves potentially dangerous permission bits (setuid, setgid, sticky).
**Learning:** Utilities that copy file metadata (like `shutil.copymode`) can inadvertently transfer elevated execution privileges from an untrusted source to a generated output. This can lead to privilege escalation if the destination file is later executed.
**Prevention:** Explicitly mask file permissions when restoring metadata. Use `os.chmod(dest, stat.S_IMODE(source_stat.st_mode) & 0o777)` to ensure only standard read/write/execute permissions are copied, dropping the setuid, setgid, and sticky bits.
